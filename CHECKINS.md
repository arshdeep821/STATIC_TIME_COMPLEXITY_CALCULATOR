Use this file to commit information clearly documenting your check-ins' content. If you want to store more information/details besides what's required for the check-ins that's fine too. Make sure that your TA has had a chance to sign off on your check-in each week (before the deadline); typically you should discuss your material with them before finalizing it here.

## Check In 1

#### Brief description of your discussions within your team so far

- Had some ideas with regards to analyzing space complexity but much of brainstorming is still yet to be done and discucssed. 
- Also thought of an idea of using Infer to analyze errors within the code and creating a visualizer that states where these errors will occur and what type of error it is. Still a good amount of planning left to do

#### Planned follow-up tasks 

- Will hold another couple meetings to further discuss the topic and route we want to go next week.
- Also will start looking at different analysis frameworks and see which one fits our use case the best
- Finalize the idea we want to create the project around and start creating a timeline for which person will take on which task
