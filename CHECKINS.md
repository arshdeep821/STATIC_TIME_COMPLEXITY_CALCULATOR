Use this file to commit information clearly documenting your check-ins' content. If you want to store more information/details besides what's required for the check-ins that's fine too. Make sure that your TA has had a chance to sign off on your check-in each week (before the deadline); typically you should discuss your material with them before finalizing it here.

## Check In 1

#### Brief description of your discussions within your team so far

- Had some ideas with regards to analyzing space complexity but much of brainstorming is still yet to be done and discucssed. 
- Also thought of an idea of using Infer to analyze errors within the code and creating a visualizer that states where these errors will occur and what type of error it is. Still a good amount of planning left to do
- Could use concurrency analysis tools to visualize problem areas like deadlocks and give warnings for concurrently accessed/changed global variables.

#### Planned follow-up tasks 

- Will hold another couple meetings to further discuss the topic and route we want to go next week.
- Also will start looking at different analysis frameworks and see which one fits our use case the best. Research about the tech stack of this project, and the pros & cons of different languages/ tools/ frameworks.
- Finalize the idea we want to create the project around and start creating a timeline for which person will take on which task 
- Brainstorm additional program properties to be analyzed (or review existing ones)

## Check In 2

#### Brief description of your planned program analysis (and visualisation, if applicable) ideas

- We plan to create a program analysis tool for specific type checking such as NULLs, strings, ints, etc.
- Visualization will be given user inputted code, to indicated where types may not align with the logic of the code

#### Notes of any important changes/feedback from TA discussion

- Our TA said not to have a general type checker but instead to create a type checker based on some types such as NULLs, Strings, Ints as that is easier to implement

#### Any planned follow-up tasks or features still to design

- Still need to discuss exact implementation strategy and how the visualization tool will actually look

#### Planned division of main responsibilities between team members

- Part of the group will work on using the libraries to perform the program analysis whereas the other part of the group will work on the visualization tool

#### Summary of progress so far

- Finalized our idea and will start implementing

#### Roadmap for what should be done when, including specific goals for completion by future Milestones (propose at least three such goals per future Milestone, along with who will work on them; you can revise these later as needed)

Check in 3 (week 10):
- Split the team into groups (visualization and program analysis) and assign tasks for each group
- Create mockups for visualization and program analysis (done by respective teams)
- Complete first user study (done by Sahib)

Check in 4 (week 11):
- Create MVP and working implementation for program analysis tool (done by program analysis team)
- Create MVP and working implementation for visualization (done by visualization team)
- Incorporate feedback from first user study (Sahib)

Check in 5 (week 12):
- Test throughly (each team tests respective tool)
- Create video (whichever team has already finished)
- Incorpoate any final feedback from user studies (whichever team the feedback is for)
