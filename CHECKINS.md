Use this file to commit information clearly documenting your check-ins' content. If you want to store more information/details besides what's required for the check-ins that's fine too. Make sure that your TA has had a chance to sign off on your check-in each week (before the deadline); typically you should discuss your material with them before finalizing it here.

## Check In 1

#### Planned follow-up tasks 

Will hold another couple meetings to further discuss the topic and route we want to go next week.
