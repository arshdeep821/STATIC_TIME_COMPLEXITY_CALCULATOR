## Summary of the content of User Studies:

In conducting the two user studies on our Python run-time analysis tool, participants were asked to test/code non-recursive functions. The first user desired deeper insights into runtime computations and faced challenges with library imports, while developing a factorial function and a linked list traversal. The second user, focusing on "Two Sum" and "Is Valid" problems from Leetcode, valued the tool's ease of use and straight forward Big O notation without needing detailed runtime explanations. The feedback from both participants led to refining the tool's focus on usability and applicability across various programming tasks, opting against detailed computational explanations to enhance user satisfaction and adding the ability to include user-defined functions. All in all, the tool was much enjoyed from both participants as it was quick and easy to receive a big-O notation of the run-time.
